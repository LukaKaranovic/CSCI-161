# Dynamic Array, ArrayMap, and LinkedMap

This is an application that implements classes for the dynamic array data structure and the array map and linked list map abstract data types. Use this program to implement
said data structures/types and their classes for use in other applications. Class methods include traversing, inserting, removing, searching, etc.



## Technologies

This application has been developed using C++ programming language. This application can be built and run on a system with a GCC compiler. Unix make utility is necessary 
to build as well as to run the unit test of this application. 

To perform unit test of this application GCC compiler must have Boost Unit Test Library installed. This application has been tested on Debian 4.9 (Linux) with GCC 6.3.0 
and BOOST 1.62. 



## Build and Installation

To build this application from the source code enter following command from the root directory of this application.

	>make

To clean the files from the previous build of the application enter following command from the root directory of the application.

	>make clean

There is no installation script to install this application automatically. However, you can manually install this application by copying the executable file (any of the 
sort files) from the 'bin' subdirectory of this application to a system directory, for example, '/usr/local/bin', that is listed in the '$PATH' environment variable of 
your system. You need system privileges in order to copy the executable into your target directory.



## Usage

You can run the arraymap, linkedmap, and map executables of this application one after another from the root directory of this application by entering the following 
command.

	>make run
	
You can run the arraymap executable of this application from the root directory of this application by entering the following command.

	>make run-array-map

You can run the arraymap executable of this application from the root directory of this application by entering the following command.

    >make run-linked-map

You can run the arraymap executable of this application from the root directory of this application by entering the following command.

	>make run-map

You can run the arraymap, linkedmap, and map unit tests of this application one after another from the root directory of this application by entering the following 
command.

	>make test

You can run the 'arraymap' unit test of this application from the root directory of this application by entering the following command.

	>make test-array-map

You can run the 'linkedmap' unit test of this application from the root directory of this application by entering the following command.

	>make test-linked-map
	
You can run the 'map' unit test of this application from the root directory of this application by entering the following command.

	>make test-map


If you have manually installed 'arraymap' by copying 'bin/arraymap' executable file in your system directory, for example, in '/usr/local/bin', which is 
listed in your '$PATH' environment variable, you can run 'arraymap' by inputting the following on the command prompt from your local folder:

    >bin/arraymap 
    
If you have manually installed 'linkedmap' by copying 'bin/linkedmap' executable file in your system directory, for example, in '/usr/local/bin', which is 
listed in your '$PATH' environment variable, you can run 'linkedmap' by inputting the following on the command prompt from your local folder:

    >bin/linkedmap 
    
If you have manually installed 'map' by copying 'bin/map' executable file in your system directory, for example, in '/usr/local/bin', which is 
listed in your '$PATH' environment variable, you can run 'map' by inputting the following on the command prompt from your local folder:

    >bin/map
