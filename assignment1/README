# Sorting Algorithms

This is an application that sorts an array given by an input file, and stores the sorted version in an output file. It sorts using one of five sorting algorithms: bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, and quick sort. The application takes an array, displays it on the console, copies it, sorts both the original and the copy of the array, and stores the sorted array in an output file.



## Technologies

This application has been developed using C++ programming language. This application can be built and run on a system with a GCC compiler. Unix make utility is necessary to build as well as to run the unit test of this application. 

To perform unit test of this application GCC compiler must have Boost Unit Test Library installed. This application has been tested on Debian 4.9 (Linux) with GCC 6.3.0 and BOOST 1.62. 



## Build and Installation

To build this application from the source code enter following command from the root directory of this application.

	>make

To clean the files from the previous build of the application enter following command from the root directory of the application.

	>make clean

There is no installation script to install this application automatically. However, you can manually install this application by copying the executable file (any of the sort files) from the 'bin' subdirectory of this application to a system directory, for example, '/usr/local/bin', that is listed in the '$PATH' environment variable of your system. You need system privileges in order to copy the executable into your target directory.



## Usage

You can run all sorting algorithm executables of this application one after another from the root directory of this application by entring following command.

	>make run

You can run only the 'sort_bubble' executable of this application from the root directory of this application by entering following command.

	>make run-sort-bubble

You can run only the 'sort_selection' executable of this application from the root directory of this application by entering following command.

	>make run-sort-selection

You can run only the 'sort_insertion' executable of this application from the root directory of this application by entering following command.

	>make run-sort-insertion

You can run only the 'sort_merge' executable of this application from the root directory of this application by entering following command.

	>make run-sort-merge

You can run only the 'sort_quick' executable of this application from the root directory of this application by entering following command.

	>make run-sort-quick

You can run the utility and all sorting algorithm unit tests of this application one after another from the root directory of this application by entering following command.

	>make test

You can run the 'sort_bubble' unit test of this application from the root directory of this application by entering following command.

	>make test-sort-bubble

You can run the 'sort_selection' unit test of this application from the root directory of this application by entering following command.

	>make test-sort-selection

You can run the 'sort_insertion' unit test of this application from the root directory of this application by entering following command.

	>make test-sort-insertion

You can run the 'sort_merge' unit test of this application from the root directory of this application by entering following command.

	>make test-sort-merge

You can run the 'sort_quick' unit test of this application from the root directory of this application by entering following command.

	>make test-sort-quick

You can run the 'utility' unit test of this application from the root directory of this application by entering following command.

	>make test-utility

If you have manually installed 'sort_bubble' by copying 'bin/sort_bubble executable file in your system directory, for example, in '/usr/local/bin', which is listed in your '$PATH' environment variable, you can run 'sort_bubble' by inputting the following on the command prompt from your local folder:

    >bin/sort_bubble <input-file> <output-file>

If you have manually installed 'sort_selection' by copying 'bin/sort_selection executable file in your system directory, for example, in '/usr/local/bin', which is listed in your '$PATH' environment variable, you can run 'sort_selection' by inputting the following on the command prompt from your local folder:

    >bin/sort_selection <input-file> <output-file>

If you have manually installed 'sort_insertion' by copying 'bin/sort_insertion executable file in your system directory, for example, in '/usr/local/bin', which is listed in your '$PATH' environment variable, you can run 'sort_insertion' by inputting the following on the command prompt from your local folder:

    >bin/sort_insertion <input-file> <output-file>

If you have manually installed 'sort_merge' by copying 'bin/sort_merge executable file in your system directory, for example, in '/usr/local/bin', which is listed in your '$PATH' environment variable, you can run 'sort_merge' by inputting the following on the command prompt from your local folder:

    >bin/sort_merge <input-file> <output-file>

If you have manually installed 'sort_quick' by copying 'bin/sort_quick executable file in your system directory, for example, in '/usr/local/bin', which is listed in your '$PATH' environment variable, you can run 'sort_quick' by inputting the following on the command prompt from your local folder:

    >bin/sort_quick <input-file> <output-file>
