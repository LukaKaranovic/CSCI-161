# DynamicArray and SimpleSet Data Structures

This is an application that implements numerous class methods for the dynamic array and simple set data structures. Use this program to implement
said data structures and their classes for use in other applications. Class methods include file reading and writing, inserting, deleting, incrementing, and combining 
elements, and comparing arrays.



## Technologies

This application has been developed using C++ programming language. This application can be built and run on a system with a GCC compiler. Unix make utility is necessary 
to build as well as to run the unit test of this application. 

To perform unit test of this application GCC compiler must have Boost Unit Test Library installed. This application has been tested on Debian 4.9 (Linux) with GCC 6.3.0 
and BOOST 1.62. 



## Build and Installation

To build this application from the source code enter following command from the root directory of this application.

	>make

To clean the files from the previous build of the application enter following command from the root directory of the application.

	>make clean

There is no installation script to install this application automatically. However, you can manually install this application by copying the executable file (any of the 
sort files) from the 'bin' subdirectory of this application to a system directory, for example, '/usr/local/bin', that is listed in the '$PATH' environment variable of 
your system. You need system privileges in order to copy the executable into your target directory.



## Usage

You can run both the dynamic array and simple set executables of this application one after another from the root directory of this application by entering following 
command.

	>make run
	
You can run the dynamic array executable of this application from the root directory of this application by entering following command.

	>make run-dynamic-array

You can run the simple set executable of this application from the root directory of this application by entering following command.

	>make run-simple-set

You can run both the dynamic array and simple set unit tests of this application one after another from the root directory of this application by entering following 
command.

	>make test

You can run the 'dynamicarray' unit test of this application from the root directory of this application by entering following command.

	>make test-dynamic-array
	
You can run the 'simpleset' unit test of this application from the root directory of this application by entering following command.

	>make test-simple-set

If you have manually installed 'dynamicarray' by copying 'bin/dynamicarray' executable file in your system directory, for example, in '/usr/local/bin', which is 
listed in your '$PATH' environment variable, you can run 'dynamicarray' by inputting the following on the command prompt from your local folder:

    >bin/dynamicarray <input-file> <output-file>
    
If you have manually installed 'simpleset' by copying 'bin/simpleset' executable file in your system directory, for example, in '/usr/local/bin', which is 
listed in your '$PATH' environment variable, you can run 'simpleset' by inputting the following on the command prompt from your local folder:

    >bin/simpleset <input-file> <output-file>
